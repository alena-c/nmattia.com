I'm an engineer, currently brexiting my way back to Zurich.

For a condensed version of my experience, have a look at my <a

Here are some of the projects I played with lately:

 * [*Halytics* <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](http://github.com/nmattia/halytics)
   is a small Haskell project making it easy to work with stats and analytics.
   Have a look at the [docs](http://docs.nmattia.com/halytics).

 * [*mask* <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](http://github.com/nmattia/mask) is a
   basic Makefile parser for Haskell. Have a look at the
   [docs](http://docs.nmattia.com/mask).

I've got a few other things going on on [github](http://github.com/nmattia).

Here are some posts from something that's not quite a blog yet:

 * [Lens and Linear: 2048's logic in 22 lines](posts/2016-08-19-lens-linear-2048.html)
 * [Puzzle solving in Haskell](posts/2016-07-31-bfs-tree.html)
 * [Parallel computing with DNA](posts/2015-04-20-parallel-dna.html)
