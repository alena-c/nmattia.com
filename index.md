I'm an engineer living in Switzerland and working at [Tweag
I/O](http://tweag.io). For more, checkout the [about page](/about.html).


Here are some projects I played with lately (there's more [on
github](http://github.com/nmattia)):

 * [*stutter* <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](http://github.com/nmattia/stutter)
   is a command-line string generator. You give it a regex-looking thing, it
   generates the strings.

 * [*mask* <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](http://github.com/nmattia/mask) is a
   Makefile parser for Haskell. More in the
   [docs](http://nmattia.github.io/mask/).

Here are some thoughts about software (you can find more in the [blog
section](/blog.html)):

 * [cio: cached HTTP requests for a smooth Jupyter experience!](posts/2018-08-21-cio-cached-http-requests-jupyter.html)
 * [Nix: A Reproducible Setup for Linux and macOS](posts/2018-03-21-nix-reproducible-setup-linux-macos.html)
 * [Introducing stutter, the anti-grep](posts/2017-05-01-release-stutter.html)
 * [Recovering forgotten passwords with stutter and GNU parallel](posts/2017-03-05-crack-luks-stutter-gnu-parallel.html)
 * [Lens and Linear: 2048's logic in 22 lines](posts/2016-08-19-lens-linear-2048.html)
 * [Parallel computing with DNA](posts/2015-04-20-parallel-dna.html)
