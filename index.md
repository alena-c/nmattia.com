I'm an engineer living in Switzerland. I currently work with [Tweag
I/O](http://tweag.io). We do cool stuff, have a look!

For a condensed version of my experience, have a look at my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>.<br/>

Here are some of the projects I played with lately:

 * [*Halytics* <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](http://github.com/nmattia/halytics)
   is a small Haskell project making it easy to work with stats and analytics.
   Have a look at the [docs](http://nmattia.github.io/halytics/).

 * [*mask* <i class="fa fa-github"></i>](http://github.com/nmattia/mask) is a
   basic Makefile parser for Haskell. Have a look at the
   [docs](http://nmattia.github.io/mask/).

I've got a few other things going on on [github](http://github.com/nmattia).

Here are some posts from something that's not quite a blog yet:

 * [Recovering forgotten passwords with stutter and GNU parallel](posts/2017-03-05-crack-luks-stutter-gnu-parallel.html)
